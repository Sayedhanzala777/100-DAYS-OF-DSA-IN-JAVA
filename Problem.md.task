Day 12: Recursion – Intermediate Problems
Activity 1: Basic Recursive Thinking

Task 1: Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of digits of a number.
Example:
Input → 1234
Output → 10

Task 2: Write a recursive function to find the nth term of the Fibonacci series.
Example:
Input → n = 6
Output → 8

Activity 2: Recursive String Operations

Task 3: Write a recursive function to reverse a string.
Example:
Input → "hello"
Output → "olleh"

Task 4: Write a recursive function to check whether a string is a palindrome.
Example:
Input → "madam"
Output → true

Activity 3: Divide and Conquer

Task 5: Write a recursive function to find the maximum element in an array.
Example:
Input → [2, 5, 9, 1, 7]
Output → 9

Activity 4: Recursion with Decision Making

Task 6: Write a recursive function to count how many times a target element appears in an array.
Example:
Input → [1, 2, 2, 3, 2], target = 2
Output → 3

Activity 5: Classic Recursive Problem

Task 7: Write a recursive function to calculate the power of a number (xⁿ).
Example:
Input → 2, 5
Output → 32
