// Activity 1 : Merge Sort
// Task1 > Implement Merge Sort algorithm to sort an integer array in ascending order.
// Task2 > Modify Merge Sort to sort in descending order.


// Activity 2 : Quick Sort
// Task3 > Implement Quick Sort using the last element as the pivot.
// Task4 > Modify Quick Sort to sort in descending order.


// Activity 3 : Advanced Sorting Practice
// Task5 > Sort an array of strings using Merge Sort.
// Task6 > Sort an array of custom objects (students with marks) using Quick Sort.


// Activity 4 : Sorting Analysis
// Task7 > Compare the time complexity of Merge Sort and Quick Sort for large arrays.
// Task8 > Print which sorting algorithm performs faster based on execution time.


// Activity 5 : Challenge Problem
// Task9 > Implement Merge Sort to count inversions in an array (number of pairs where arr[i] > arr[j] for i < j).
// Task10 > Write a function that merges two already sorted arrays into one sorted array.
