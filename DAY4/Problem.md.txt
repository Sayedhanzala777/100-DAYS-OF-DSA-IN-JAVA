Day 4 : Sorting Algorithms
Activity 1: Bubble Sort

Task 1: Write a Java program to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Task 2: Modify the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the array in descending order.

Activity 2: Selection Sort

Task 3: Write a program to perform Selection Sort on an integer array.
Task 4: Print the array after each pass to visualize the sorting process.

Activity 3: Insertion Sort

Task 5: Implement the Insertion Sort algorithm.
Task 6: Test it with both sorted and unsorted arrays to see performance differences.

Activity 4: Sorting Practice

Task 7: Write a program that accepts an array of strings and sorts them alphabetically.
Task 8: Write a function that takes an array of custom objects (like students with names and marks) and sorts them by marks.
